                MISSION STATEMENT
            </h2>
            <p class = "main-text">
                "The Voice" in Australia alludes to a noteworthy suggestion called "The Voice to Parliament." Giving Indigenous Australians more influence over choices made by the Australian Parliament is the main goal of this program. It's a significant component of the continuous endeavor to acknowledge and make peace with the nation's Indigenous communities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Following the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017, in which Indigenous leaders demanded that a "First Nations Voice" be incorporated into the Australian Constitution, the concept for a Voice to Parliament was formed. This Voice would serve as a permanent conduit for Indigenous communities to participate in choices that impact them directly by offering counsel to the Australian Parliament on issues pertaining to Indigenous affairs.
                <br>
                <br>
                There has been discussion over the specifics of the organization and operation of this Voice to Parliament. Proponents see it as a critical step in recognizing historical wrongs committed against Indigenous Australians and enhancing the inclusivity of the decision-making process.
